## Installation

Suppose you are using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'sainnhe/vim-color-forest-night'
```

For better syntax highlighting support, please install [sheerun/vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot).

## Usage

```vim
colorscheme forest-night
```

To enable [lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) color scheme, put this in your vimrc

```vim
let g:lightline = {}
let g:lightline.colorscheme = 'forest_night'

" or this line
let g:lightline = {'colorscheme' : 'forest_night'}
```

or if you want to apply it without reload

```vim
:let g:lightline.colorscheme = 'forest_night'
:call lightline#init()
:call lightline#colorscheme()
:call lightline#update()
```

## FAQ

**Q: It doesn't work as expected.**

**A:**

1. Although this color scheme works very well without termguicolors, if you want to make it look the same as the screenshot, you need to enable it: `:set termguicolors`

2. If the color still cannot displayed properly, check output of `vim --version`, maybe your vim doesn't support `termguicolors`

3. Maybe your terminal emulator doesn't support true colors, you can test it using [this script](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/404414/print-true-color-24-bit-test-pattern)

4. If you are running vim in tmux, you need to override default true colors of tmux, as tmux cannot display true color properly: [#1246 How to use true colors in vim under tmux?](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1246)

5. There are many highlighting group links in syntax files while a color scheme may change them, enabling one color scheme based on another color scheme enabled is very likely to cause color broken. If there is any color broken, you can enable the color scheme in your vimrc instead of after vim startup.

**Q: What's your status line configuration?**

**A:** check this [gist](https://gist.github.com/sainnhe/b8240bc047313fd6185bb8052df5a8fb).

## Contribution

This color scheme is generated by [lifepillar/vim-colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate). To hack it, install this plugin and edit `templates/forest_night.colortemplate`, then rebuild the color scheme.

Currently I have only completed some very basic syntax highlighting of common filetypes which may not be accurate enough. Please feel free to open a PR if you want to optimize additional highlighting groups of a filetype or a plugin.
